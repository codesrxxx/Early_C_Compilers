<H1>Very early C compilers and language
</H1>
Several years ago, Paul Vixie and Keith Bostic found
a DECtape drive, attached it to a VAX, and offered to
read old DECtapes.  Even at the time, this was an antiquarian
pursuit, and it presented an opportunity to mine beneath the
raised floor of the computer room and unearth some of the DECtapes
we'd stored since the early 1970s.  Gradually, I've been curating
some of this, and here offer some of the artifacts.
Unfortunately existing tapes lack interesting things like
earliest Unix OS source, but some indicative fossils have been
prepared for exhibition.

<p>
As described in the <A href="chist.html">C History paper</A>, 1972-73 were
the truly formative years in the development of the C language: this is
when the transition from typeless B to weakly typed C took place, mediated
by the (Neanderthal?) NB language, of which no source seems to survive.
It was also the period in which Unix was rewritten in C.

<p>
In looking over this material, I have mixed emotions; so
much of this stuff is immature and not well-done, and there
is an element of embarrassment about displaying it.
But at the same time it does capture two
moments in a period of creativeness and may have
some historical interest. 

<p>
Two tapes are present here; the first is labeled "last1120c",
the second "prestruct-c".  I know from distant memory what
these names mean: the first is a saved copy of the compiler
preserved just as we were abandoning the PDP-11/20, which
did not have multiply or divide instructions, but instead a separate,
optional unit that did these operations (and also shifts)
by storing the operands into memory locations.
(A <A href="odd.html">story about using this hardware</A> is told elsewhere.)

<p>
It's a bit hard to get really accurate dates for these
compilers, except that they are certainly 1972-73.
There are date bits on the tape image, but they suffer
from a possible off-by-a-year error because we changed
epochs more than once during this era, and
also because the files may have been copied or fiddled
after they were the source for the compiler in contemporaneous
use.

<p>
The earlier compiler does not know about structures at all: the string
"struct" does not appear anywhere.  The second tape has a compiler
that does implement structures in a way that begins to approach
their current meaning.  Their declaration syntax seems to use <tt>()</tt> instead
of <tt>{}</tt>, but <tt>.</tt> and <tt>-></tt> for specifying members of
a structure itself and members of a pointed-to structure are both there.

<p>
Neither compiler yet handled the general
declaration syntax of today or even K&R I, with its compound declarators like
the one in
<tt>int **ipp;</tt> .
The compilers have not yet evolved the notion of
compounding of type constructors ("array of pointers to functions", for example).
These would appear, though, by 
5th or 6th edition Unix (say 1975), as described (in Postscript)
in the <A href="cman.ps">C manual</A> a couple of years after
these versions.

<p>
Instead, pointer declarations were
written in the style <tt>int ip[];</tt>.
A fossil from this era survives even in modern C, where the
notation can be used in declarations of arguments.
On the other hand, the later of the two does accept
the <tt>*</tt> notation, even though it doesn't use it.
(Evolving compilers written in their own language
are careful not take advantage of own their latest features.)

<p>
It's interesting to note that the earlier compiler has a
commented-out preparation for a "long" keyword;
the later one takes over its slot for "struct."
Implementation of long was a few years away.

<p>
Aside from their small size, perhaps the most striking thing
about these programs is their primitive construction, particularly
the many constants strewn throughout; they are used for names of
tokens, for example.  This is because the preprocessor didn't
exist at the time.

<p>
A second, less noticeable, but astonishing peculiarity is the space allocation:
temporary storage is allocated that deliberately overwrites the
beginning of the program,
smashing its initialization code to save space.
The two compilers differ in the details in how they cope with this.
In the earlier one, the start is found by naming a function;
in the later, the start is simply taken to be 0.
This indicates that the first compiler was written before
we had a machine with memory mapping, so the origin of the
program was not at location 0, whereas by the time of the second,
we had a PDP-11 that did provide mapping.
(See the <A href="hist.html">Unix History paper</A>).
In one of the files (prestruct-c/c10.c) the kludgery
is especially evident.
<p>
Links to the source of the compilers are listed below.
The files named c0?.c
are the first passes, which parses source and writes syntax
trees intermingled with some text on an intermediate file.
The c1?.c files are the code generators, which read
the trees and generate code.  The format is straight text
(with just NL characters separating lines; the browsers
I've tried cope with this).

<p>
The code generation technique uses tables of instruction
prototypes; a parse tree is recursively matched against the part of the table
corresponding to its root operator.  Restrictions
on the types and complexity
of the operands can be expressed, and the table is searched
sequentially for the earliest matching fragment.
Following each restriction specification is the expansion
specification; lower case letters are literal, upper case
things are replaced by things from the operands in the
tree.  This is described in more detail in the paper
<A href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/vol2/ctour.bun">
A Tour through the PDP-11 Compiler</A>.
(This reference is troff source; it can also be found in Postscript
or PDF forms,
though bundled with other papers, under the
<A href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/index.html">
7th Edition Manual's</A> home page.
But do note that this Tour describes the state of things
after several years had passed.

<p>
There are four tables specifying how to compile an expression
to a register, to compile only for side effects, to compile
only to test condition codes, and to compile to push on
the stack (used for function arguments, or for temporaries).
They were saved only with the "last1120c" compiler; the
tables for the later one would have been similar.

<p>
The source for the last1120c compiler also has a subsidiary
table for each pass with a bit of stuff that was not
in the library, and some encoding of facts about various
operators as <tt>.s</tt> (assembler language) files.

<p>
Finally, there is the <i>cvopt</i> program, used
to convert the nonce-language expression template
tables into assembler.
With a lot of handwork, there is probably enough material
to construct a working version of the last1120c compiler,
where "works" means "turns source into PDP-11 assembler."
